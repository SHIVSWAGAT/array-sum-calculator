# Array Sum Calculator
This simple C program calculates the sum of elements in an array. Users are prompted to input the number of elements in the array and then provide the individual elements. The program then computes and displays the sum of the entered elements.
Prerequisites
* C Compiler: Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system. If not, you can download and install one, such as GCC.
# How to Use
* 		Open a C compiler or integrated development environment (IDE).
* 		Copy and paste the provided code into a new file.
* 		Save the file with a .c extension, for example, sum_calculator.c.
* 		Compile the code using the C compiler. For example, using GCC: gcc sum_calculator.c -o sum_calculator.
* 		Run the compiled executable: ./sum_calculator.
* 		Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the number of elements and their values.
* 		The program will display the sum of the entered elements.
# Code Overview
* The program begins by prompting the user to input the number of elements in the array.
* An array of size n is declared to store the input elements.
* Users are then asked to input each element individually.
* The program calculates the sum of the array elements using a loop.
* Finally, the sum is displayed on the screen.
Example
yaml


Enter the number of elements in the array: 5 
Enter 5 elements: Enter element 1: 10 Enter element 2: 20 Enter element 3: 30 Enter element 4: 40 Enter element 5: 50 The sum of elements is: 150
